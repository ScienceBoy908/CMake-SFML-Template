# CMake-SFML-Template
My first real contribution to GitHub. This is basically a template for SFML projects using CMake and C++. It does however use Python to create an embedded resource header.

## How to install
First, clone the repo into a new folder.

Second, change the python reference in the CMakeLists.txt uses whatever version of python works in your command prompt. Sometime's it's python, python3, or python3.12

Third, create a build folder and run "cmake .." from within it using the command prompt. If it says that it couldn't find python then check step 2 or just download python.
